                    <p>"It's all about the passion," DJ ROM hits us, and the boys around him nod. In music or in love, we ask? Harddrive winks, and then replies: "Well, you can't have music without love." Swoon!</p>
                    <p>If you've been anywhere on the planet in the past year, you've probably heard "PARTY OF YOUR LIFETIME,", the unstoppable earworm from heartthrob boy band On-Lyne. It's certainly been playing non-stop here at The Sentinel! So when we got to sit down with the boys themselves, we made sure to ask them all our burning questions.</p>
                    <p>"Sorry, fellas," Drillbit smiles, "but I'm getting kinda sick of pizza." The others boo and playfully give him a shove. The five boys share about life on the road for their new tour: "It's a lot of takeout," muses DJ ROM. "When we're on the move, it's always there for us." Packet insists that tacos beat pizza any day. "They're entitled to their opinions," Zeke smirks a known lover of Big Bytes himself.</p>
                    <p>Harddrive is the first to jump in when we ask about girls. "Dude, who doesn't love girls? They're so rad. Thank you, women!" he shouts, flexing a bicep a picture-perfect shot.</p>
                    <p>"We gotta show love to the ladies, no question," Drillbit adds. "They keep us inspired." Do any of them have lucky ladies? "That's a secret," says DJ ROM. Harddrive winks. Is that a yes? Who knows, maybe their next muse will be one of you!</p>

                        All eyes have been on On-Lyne since their first hit, "RUNNING LATE." Packet tells us he first realized they were famous when he was recognized at the grocery store. "I was out buying a Pep-Cola Clear when someone asked me to sign their CD," he shared. "I couldn't believe they were starstruck by me!" The boys love their fans, but their super-charged rise to fame has taken some getting used to. "I'm grateful for all the love," says Zeke, running a hand through his perfectly-styled hair, "but I kind of miss going outside without dodging camera flashes, you know?"</p>
                    <p>"The internet is wild," says DJ ROM, about On- Lyne's message as a band. "The tech is developing every day. There's so many ways to connect, and our music is all about riding that wave." There's a moment of quiet, with nods all around, when Drillbit speaks up. "I just want this all to mean something," he concludes with a smile. "What we do goes way beyond the tracks, the crowds, the tours. I'm tryna create something that lives on, long, long after we're gone." Don't worry, boys we already know you're unforgettable!</p>
