<body>
    <h1>Documentation page</h1>
        
    <h2>0. Website Goal</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to take a piece of media and convert it as closely as possible into a website.</p>
    <p>The source image is a teaser image for an upcoming update in the online multiplayer looter-shooter Warframe.</p>
    <p>Besides the purpose of being project, the site also serves as a cool thing to look at for people who are both interested in Warframe and web design/development.</p>

    <h2>1. Header Section</h2>
    <p>The top part of the page features three distinct areas stacked on top of each other:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The top section is an empty box.</li>
        <li>The middle section contains the publication name "MYSTERIOUS NAME 1999" and "KINEMATIK PUBLISHING" in a smaller size.</li>
        <li>The bottom section has the main headline "THE SENTINEL," which is the name of the newspaper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Article Section</h2>
    <p>This section is divided into two columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The left column holds the main content of the article, which is made up of multiple paragraphs of placeholder text.</li>
        <li>The right column includes an image (a group of people) along with a quote and some additional text.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Navigation Section</h2>
    <p>This area is present but currently empty, it can be removed later or used if needed.</p>

    <h2>4. Aside Section</h2>
    <p>Another area that is empty at the moment because it is being used to create the layout for the page.</p>

    <h2>5. Footer Section</h2>
    <p>At the bottom of the page, this section is empty.</p>

    <p>In essence, the layout has a traditional newspaper style with a header, article section, and footer.</p>

    <h2>6. Notes Section</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>This layout is a basic newspaper format.</p></li>
        <li><p>The article/main content section is divided into two columns, one for text and one for images and quotes.</p></li>
        <li><p>The header contains the publication's name and the article's headline.</p></li>
        <li><p>The footer, aside, and navigation sections are in place for layout purposes, but do not hold content.</p></li>
        <li><p>Some of the fonts found in the source material are very hard to replicate.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. TODO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>The background needs to move with the page.</p></li>
        <li><p>Currently, the page resizes to a narrower version of the current one. The planned responsive design is to have the elements on the page stack vertically, to mimic an article being viewed on mobile.</p></li>
        <li><p>The color of the page needs to more closely match the source material.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the page is opened from the direct link, because the default viewport length on desktop is 100%, the site becomes squished down. Need to fix this issue somehow.</p></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Version 3.21.25 (Prototype 1)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Dimensions of website adjusted to more closely match source material.</p></li>
        <li><p>Blockquote text modified to more closely match source material.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reorganized CSS code.</p></li>
        <li><p>Blockquote text modified to more closely match source material.</p></li>
        <li><p>All text now has a font appleid to it.</p></li>
    </ul>
