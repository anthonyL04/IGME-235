    <h2>Description</h2>

    <img src="dig-dug-burnt.png" alt="Dig Dug gameplay">

    <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your
        shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this
        are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase
        you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you
        can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]</p>

        This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While
        a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And
        maybe they were into horror movies too.
